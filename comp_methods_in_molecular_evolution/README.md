This was quite a fun project I did for my final in MCB 5472- computational methods in molecular evolution 


Homing endonucleases (HEs) are selfish genetic elements found in every domain of life, often within type I introns or inteins. I tested the canonical view that active homing endonucleases are not found within the genome sequences of multicellular Eukaryotes. Through this project I demonstrated that there are several locations in coding and noncoding regions in multicellular Eukaryotes with high sequence similarity to known HEs, challenging this view-- see the presentation powerpoint I gave and the short write up.
